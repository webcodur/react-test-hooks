# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

**참고: 단방향 작업입니다. 일단 퇴거하면 돌아갈 수 없습니다!**

빌드 도구와 구성 선택이 만족스럽지 않으면 언제든지 "이젝트"할 수 있습니다. 이 명령은 프로젝트에서 단일 빌드 종속성을 제거합니다.

대신 모든 구성 파일과 과도 종속성(웹 팩, Babel, ESLint 등)을 프로젝트에 복사하여 사용자가 이를 완전히 제어할 수 있도록 합니다. "eject"를 제외한 모든 명령은 계속 작동하지만 복사된 스크립트를 가리키므로 수정할 수 있습니다. 이 시점에서 당신은 혼자입니다.

eject는 절대 사용할 필요가 없습니다. 큐레이션된 기능 세트는 소규모 및 중간 규모 배포에 적합하며, 이 기능을 사용할 의무가 없다고 생각하면 안 됩니다. 그러나 준비가 되었을 때 이 도구를 사용자 지정할 수 없다면 이 도구는 유용하지 않을 것입니다.
